          <p>September 22nd - October 6th: Computer Science Engineering</p>
          <p>Recently, a classmate and I worked on an MIT App Inventor project to create a spinoff of Googles PC version of Atari Breakout. The main goal of our project was to create an app that was user interactive using appropriate algorithms for different scenarios, and overall, live up to this

The objective of the app we made was to try and get rid of the blocks at the top of the screen by navigating a ball with a slider at the bottom of the page. The process of  brainstorming, developing, and launching the app, is
            logged on this <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/dublinusd.org/document/d/1DAOuJ40p45xB9l8yI2xw1iQiCl-lmKGJTdvxZBxAb-k/edit?usp=sharing" target=_blank>project notebook</a> .  I wish I could say the development process was perfect, but naturally my partner and I ran into a few problems along the way. For example, we were not able to perfect the speed the ball travelled as the levels progressed or make the slider that helps you navigate the screen invisible right away. It took some time, trouble shooting, and some help from our peers and teachers, but we eventually got it to be just the way we wanted. It was very important that my partner and I could work well together, and do even amounts of work.

          <p>Forty percent of the national food supply is never eaten. Food is either left to expire, or is thrown away as uneaten leftovers. So my partner and I created a database software named Food Foresight that scans food labels and allows the consumer to enter information such as expiration dates then, an app sends out daily updates on expiring foods so the user can consume the product, therefore minimizing food wastage. After developing the software, we tested

The application alerted us about the status of the expiration date on the item without fail. However it did take quite a bit of trouble shooting to get there. Throughout the testing process my partner and I ran into a few bugs. For example, the app was not very user interactive, and assumed lots of information about a product if the user did not input it. I persevered, and tackled each problem one at a time, and we reached a decent final product with lots of benefits. Some benefits of having the app include saving money from the moment you use it, and the fact that the product benefits a wide range of consumers including chefs, the general population, restaurant workers, and places where the use of packaged foods is common such as military, charity, and NASA organizations. The  database we created was made using the Couchbase Server 4.6 software. The database has the following <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lWzeHhhpxgHO70YQcXroB14TIcpNVk6SCzVcMh7xeCA/edit?usp=sharing" target=_blank>fields</a>-  product name, expiration date, product status, and the activity timer tracking the product status. Once this database was programmed, we embedded the QR reader scanner into an iOS app with the database, and an alert system for the expiration date in it. In the future, we could add extensions including a feature where allergies of the consumer are acknowledged and stock management.
