          <p>The dream for me has always been pursuing a career in engineering and marketing. However, right now my goal is to tenaciously work until I get there. My name is Niharika Suravarjjala, and I am obsessed with computers and growing technology. From the moment I started using them, I knew that this is what I wanted to do. I knew I had to finish high school strong with an advanced diploma and experience in AP Computer science. Then move on to college, preferably the California Institute of Technology, and pursue digital marketing and software engineering there. After my bachelors degree, I plan to find a job in the field, and continue my studies in software engineering as I develop my career. The engineering field lets me innovate and create without limits, opening a new window of opportunity for me.  </p>
          <p>Recently,  I created an app that would track the expiration date of a product an individual is storing. I had to brainstorm, plan, build, then work towards my goal. Along the way I ran into technical problems building my database as well as physical problems such as numerous use case scenarios I had to go through, yet I persevered through. Reacting to each problem differently,  and tackling each one to reach a better end product. Through this project I learned many different skills and work values, but the most important ones would be having versatility and being able to respond to the issues that may come up in the process. </p>
          <p>I have also gathered lots of knowledge from the work experience I have had so far as well as the extracurricular activities I am involved in. I have had experience as a youth mentor for young engineers in robotics, a math tutor for children, as well as an internship with Couchbase to help program the backend of their database. I also am a part of my school basketball team, and a dance group. From these activities and jobs,  I have learned how to be patient, work with different types of people, as well as what it takes to accomplish a job well done. Being an active part of the engineering field not only excites me, but motivates me to react to problems around the world and look at technology through different lenses. </p>
          <p>As you can see by now, most everything I do relates to engineering or has an underlying goal of achieving something using technology. If you like what you have read so far, please check out the rest of my website. Thank you. </p>
